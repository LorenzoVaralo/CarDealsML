# CarDealsML

Data Science project about predicting car deal prices, with the intent to classify good used car deals comparing the predicted price with the actual price.
For this project I made a Web Scraper for exploring the most recent car deals in the OLX website, I collected data about thoudands of car deals throughout many days, so I can use this data to train a regression Machine Learning algorithm.
